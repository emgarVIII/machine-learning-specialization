## Project Highlights

Here are some highlights of the projects I've completed during this specialization. These projects represent a diverse range of applications in machine learning, including regression, classification, and regularization. All in Python.

1. **Restaurant Profit Prediction with Linear Regression**

   In this project, I played the role of a restaurant franchise CEO looking to open a new restaurant in a city. Using historical data on profits and populations from cities where the chain already has restaurants, I built a linear regression model to identify potential cities that might yield higher profits for the new restaurant.

2. **University Admission Probability with Logistic Regression**

   As an administrator of a university department, my task was to determine an applicant's chance of admission based on their scores on two exams. I built a logistic regression model using historical data from previous applicants that included the applicantâ€™s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. People who are placed above the line are most likely to be accepted into the University.

3. **Microchip Quality Assurance with Regularized Logistic Regression**

   As a product manager in a fabrication plant, my goal was to predict whether a microchip passes quality assurance (QA) based on results from two different tests. Using a dataset of test results on past microchips, I built a regularized logistic regression model that assists in determining whether microchips should be accepted or rejected.

Each of these projects posed unique challenges and learning opportunities, enhancing my understanding and skills in various aspects of machine learning, data analysis and software engineering.
